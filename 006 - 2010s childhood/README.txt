THE ORIGINAL PROJECT FILE FOR THIS VIDEO GOT CORRUPTED A WHILE AGO AND HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNUSABLE ON MY COMPUTER FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. I PUT THE FILE ONLINE ANYWAY IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE WOULD TRY TO FIX IT... 

...AND THEN THE VERY NEXT DAY @uhwot ON GITHUB CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND RECOVERED ALMOST ALL OF THE DATA!!! 

I STILL HAD TO MANUALLY RECONSTRUCT SOME OF THE ANIMATION (EXCLUDING THE SUB-SCENE THAT ANIMATES THE LITERAL COMPUTER SCREEN BECAUSE IT HAS TOO MANY MISSING KEYFRAMES,) BUT YOU CAN NOW USE BLENDER 3.6.10 OR HIGHER TO OPEN "2010s childhood_RECONSTRUCTED.blend" AND USE THESE FILES AGAIN. 

I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS THIS CORRUPTED PROJECT FOR NEARLY 3 YEARS UNTIL @uhwot ON GITHUB STEPPED IN AND SAVED THIS. THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ENJOY
