FINALLY! The most ambitious thing I've ever made is now free to download. In this repo, you can find the animation project files and audio tracks to all 20 episodes of [Stickmen 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1IR2gCDHo8Lt013a7_Fns7Yh7xB7IG2f), plus some extra things.

ðŸ“‚ **Hit the big green download button at the top (Code -> Download .ZIP) to download these files, or click "Download" on an individual file to only grab what you need.**

Things to note:
- Some folders have a README.txt in them that you should probably read
- You need to know how to use Blender 3D to use these files, I do not offer instructions or tutorials
- The "wavetro" name and logo is still fully-copyrighted by me, as well as the assets that are clearly just other people's YouTube files or large corporate brands/logos used as props
- Everything else here (especially the non-cavefolder characters and audio tracks) are licensed under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
- I still own the full copyright and distribution rights to the final renders of these videos and the Stickmen 2020 brand in general
- The details in this README are subject to change, please check this page sometimes if you're storing this file on your computer locally

Basically, just credit me in whatever you make with these and don't make money off whatever it is. I DO NOT ENDORSE WHATEVER GETS MADE WITH THESE FILES.
